To run the assembler, open visual studio code and click on the run button at the top right. Make sure that the testcase has the same exact name as the one included in this folder.

This assembler operates on the assumption that the instruction is 100% correct, in the following format:

ins op1,op2,op3\n
or 
ins op1,op2,op3\t

!! It does not operate if there's a space after the operands.!!

This way of operation is based on the uploaded test case to the elearn.
